Software development  processes are  constantly evolving  and transforming  rapidly with rapid changes in technology. Recent innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to significant  changes  in  software  development  practices.  AI  tools  can  greatly  improve traditional software development processes by giving developers the ability to build projects smarter, faster and more effectively. These tools can be used for a variety of tasks such as code generation, test automation, bug analysis, and performance improvements. ChatGPT, which is an  artificial intelligence-based language model  and has  made a  deep impact in almost every field, can help  software developers write code faster  and in a  more natural language. In this study, the contributions  of ChatGPT to a software  development project were investigated. In the study, basic information about the use of ChatGPT in the software development process is presented. Implementations were carried out on a software project to evaluate some of ChatGPT's capabilities in the context of software development. For this purpose,  a software  development process  was designed  based on  the answers  given by ChatGPT. Various questions about software development processes were formulated and the  answers  produced  by  the  GPT  were  evaluated.  The  results  obtained  showed  that ChatGPT  performed  excellently  in the  software  development process.  Based  on  these findings, it has been observed that AI-based models such as ChatGPT can be  effectively used  as  auxiliary  tools  in  software  development  processes  that  accelerate  traditional workflows. In addition, AI-based tools can save time and effort while improving software quality by automating testing processes.
